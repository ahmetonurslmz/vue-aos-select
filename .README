## Install

```bash
yarn add vue-aos-select

# or use npm

npm install vue-aos-select
```

Then, import and register the component:

```js
import Vue from "vue";
import vSelect from "vue-aos-select";

Vue.component("v-select", vSelect);
```

The component itself does not include any CSS. You'll need to include it separately:

```js
import "vue-aos-select/dist/vue-select.css";
```

Alternatively, you can import the scss for complete control of the component styles:

```scss
@import "vue-aos-select/src/scss/vue-select.scss";
```

You can also include vue-select directly in the browser. Check out the
[documentation for loading from CDN.](https://vue-select.org/guide/install.html#in-the-browser).
